# Word embeddings tutorial

This notebook outlines the steps to perform word embeddings using word2vec.

The exercises show how to create embeddings out of text and explore the vector space and word similarity using the vector representations.

The data used in the exercise is extracted from [DharmaOverground](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/category/2658626), a meditation-related forum.

Authors of the notebook are Teodora Vukovic and Tilia Ellendorf.
